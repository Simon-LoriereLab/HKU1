#Genomics of the human coronavirus HKU1

This repository analyzes genomes of HKU1 using Nextstrain in collaboration with the Virus and Immunity lab at Institut Pasteur (https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/virus-and-immunity/). The build was constructed using a total of 49 publicly available full-length genomes. Of note, there is strong evidence of recombination in the evolutionary history of HKU1 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1489027/), and the topology of a tree inferred with the spike sequences of the same virus set can be compared.

The phylogenies can be visualized at https://nextstrain.org/community/Simon-LoriereLab/HKU1@main/all.

This work is made possible by the open sharing of genetic data by research groups from all over the world. We gratefully acknowledge their contributions.
